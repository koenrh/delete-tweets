# Delete tweets

![](https://github.com/koenrh/delete-tweets/workflows/build/badge.svg)

This is a simple script that helps you delete tweets (or just replies or retweets)
from your timeline. There are quite a few third-party services that allow you
to delete tweets, but these very likely will not allow you to delete tweets beyond
the infamous [3,200 tweet limit](https://web.archive.org/web/20131019125213/https://dev.twitter.com/discussions/276).

## Prerequisites

Unfortunately, as of late 2018, you are required to have a Twitter Developer account
in order to create a Twitter app.

### Apply for a Twitter Developer account

1. [Create a Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply):
    1. **User profile**: Use your current Twitter @username.
    1. **Account details**: Select *I am requesting access for my own personal use*,
      set your 'Account name' to your @username, and select your 'Primary country
      of operation.
    1. **Use case details**: select 'Other', and explain in at least 300 words that
      you want to create an app to semi-automatically clean up your own tweets.
    1. **Terms of service**: Read and accept the terms.
    1. **Email verification**: Confirm your email address.
1. Now wait for your Twitter Developer account to be reviewed and approved.

### Create a Twitter app

1. [Create a new Twitter app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/create) (not
  available as long as your Twitter Developer account is pending review).
1. Set 'Access permissions' of your app to *Read and write*.

### Configure your environment

1. Open your Twitter Developer's [apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).
1. Click the 'Details' button next to your newly created app.
1. Click the 'Keys and tokens' tab, and find your keys, secret keys and access tokens.
1. Now you need to make these keys and tokens available to your shell environment.
  Assuming you are using [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)):

On the command line:
1. Create a new `.env` file in the root of the project.
2. Paste in the template below.
3. Replace the key, secrets and token with the values from Twitter.

```bash
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="your_consumer_key"
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="your_consumer_secret"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="your_access_token_secret"
```

### Get your tweet archive

1. Open the [Your Twitter data page](https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data).
1. Scroll to the 'Download your Twitter data' section at the bottom of the page.
1. Re-enter your password.
1. Click 'Request data', and wait for the email to arrive.
1. Follow the link in the email to download your Tweet data.
1. Unpack the archive, and move `tweet.js` to the same directory as this script.

## Getting started

### Local

First, install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, for example, delete any tweet from _before_ January 1, 2018:

```bash
python deletetweets.py -d 2018-01-01 tweet.js
```

Or only delete all retweets:

```bash
python deletetweets.py -r retweet tweet.js
```

### Spare tweets

You can optionally spare tweets by passing their `id_str`, setting a minimum amount of likes or retweets:

```bash
python deletetweets.py -d 2018-01-01 tweet.js --spare-ids 21235434 23498723 23498723
```

Spare tweets that have at least 10 likes, or 5 retweets:

```bash
python deletetweets.py -d 2018-01-01 tweet.js --spare-min-likes 10 --spare-min-retweets 5
```

### Docker

Alternatively, you could run this script in a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
container.

First, you need to build the Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t koenrh/delete-tweets .
```

Then, run the script using the following command.

:warning: Before you continue, you should be aware that most shells record user
input (and thus secrets) into a history file. In Bash you could prevent this by
prepending your command with a _single space_ (requires `$HISTCONTROL` to be set
to `ignorespace` or `ignoreboth`).

```bash
docker run --env TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY="$TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY" \
  --env TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET="$TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET" \
  --env TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="$TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --env TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET="$TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" \
  --volume "$PWD:/app" --rm -it koenrh/delete-tweets -d 2018-01-01 /app/tweet.js
```

You could make this command more easily accessible by putting it an executable,
and make sure that it is available in your `$PATH`.
